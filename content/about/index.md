With over 20 years experience, I'm an experienced technical leader and skilled distributed systems engineer, specialising in building and operating large software systems at high reliability while also achieving development velocity, performance and an efficient resource usage and cost base.

I have strong communication skills and a keen ability to translate business needs into precise technical solutions.

After a long and successful career at Google, I'm embarking on the challenge of building my own business focused on providing technology consulting and development services to local and global clients. I aspire to solve problems for a range of businesses, but with a specific interest in addressing problems in the agriculture and electricity industries that work towards reducing emissions and addressing climate change.

I'm actively working on building my professional network and connecting with other like-minded folks - if that sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you via the links in the sidebar (or below if you're on a small screen).

## Career Profile

I started building technology solutions for local businesses and global clients while still in high school, and continued developing my skills while studying for a BCMS from Waikato University.

After graduating in 2004, I joined a start-up ISP that grew out of work associated with my honours project and helped develop and deploy wiresless networks across a range of rural communities.

From 2007 - 2022 I worked as an SRE at Google across a wide range of teams, systems and countries, gaining singificant technical experience, leadership expertise and exposure to the biggest and best distributed systems on the planet.

## Grounding Principles

I try to apply the following principles in my work.

* **People first** - technology is an amazing force multiplier that can solve many problems, but only when it serves the people interacting with it in a positive way that enriches lives, upholds personal rights and avoids causing harm. This follows through to how we build and develop technology too - the people we work with and our relationships with each other must be strong, healthy and respectful.
* **Everything is a complex system** - with multiple influences, constraints and effects, many of which are hard to model, understand or comprehend at once. Acknowledging and managing this complexity and ambiguity is important to suceeding in life and work.
* **Open systems and transparent processes** - should be the default models in our world allowing broad interactions and growth of value to be rapidly created and shared. When circumstances require moving away from these principles, the rationale should be clearly stated.

I'm a member of the global open source, [Debian](https://www.debian.org) and [Learning From incidents](https://www.learningfromincidents.io/) communities as an application of these principles.
