With over 20 years experience in the technology space, I'm an experienced leader of teams and a skilled distributed systems engineer, specialising in cloud applications.

I started building technology solutions for local businesses and global clients while still in high school, and continued developing my skills while studying for a BCMS from Waikato University.

After graduating in 2004, I joined a start-up ISP that grew out of work associated with my honours project and helped develop and deploy wiresless networks across a range of rural communities.

From 2007 - 2022 I worked as an SRE at Google across a wide range of teams, sytems and countries, gaining singificant technical experience, leadership expertise and exposure to the biggest and best distributed systems on the planet.
