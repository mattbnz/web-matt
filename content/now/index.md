In the spirit of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about), here's where my attention is currently focused (as of {{< lastmod >}}). Past projects can be found on the
[then]({{< relref "projects" >}}) page!

## Work

* Building [On-Call Optimizer](https://oncall-optimizer.com/) - a powerful tool for software teams who want flexible, hassle-free scheduling which enables their on-call practice
to [realise its potential as a tool of growth]({{< relref "2023-08-16-oncall-opportunity.md" >}}). On-Call Optimizer is the flagship product of [MKMBA Limited](https://mkmba.nz/), our family business.
* Occasional [consulting]({{< relref "consulting" >}}) engagements for interesting clients and teams.
* Providing governance to the [CSC Buying Group](https://www.csc.org.nz/) as one of the directors.

## Community

* I'm an active member, and the treasurer for the [Hamilton Land Search and Rescue group](https://hsar.org.nz/). We work with the NZ Police to locate and assist missing parties
  around the Waikato. Typically that's been primarily hunters or trampers who have become lost or injured in the backcountry (bush), but increasingly our services are also used
  in more urban environments and the "urban fringe" to assist individuals (such as those with dementia or autism) who are missing from their loved ones.

* I'm a member of the board of trustees for Cambridge East School since 2023.

## Fun

Running, which you can follow on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/146382494). I try and get out a couple of times during the work week, and usually also with the weekend [Cambridge Harriers](https://www.sporty.co.nz/cahcnz/) runs during their winter season.
