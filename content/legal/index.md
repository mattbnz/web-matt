If you'd like to republish or re-use any page or content under different terms (e.g. commercially), please [get in touch](mailto:hi@mattb.nz).

You are very welcome (and encouraged!) to share snippets and quotes from my writing, but please include a link back to the original page.

## Privacy

I collect basic usage data about visits to the site to provide insights into how my writing is being consumed, and to understand which content is most valued and read.

I endeavour to gain these insights in the most privacy preserving manner feasible. In particular, I focus on aggregate data and do not engage in tracking of individual users or sessions via the use of cookies or other persistent data.

**Data collected from all visitors**:

* HTTP access logs containing IP address, requested URL, referring URL and user agent string. Raw logs are retained for 90 days.
* Reading minutes and progression through pages via a simple JS script ([source](https://github.com/mattbnz/web-matt/blob/main/themes/default/assets/audience-minutes.js)) based on Bert Hubert's [audience minutes](https://github.com/berthubert/audience-minutes) script. This data is collected through the above access logs (via a query string containing a counter of minutes on the page and scroll position) and is subject to the same retention policy as the raw logs. Aggregated statistics (not including user IPs) are retained indefinitely.

**Data collected when contacting me**:

If you choose to subscribe to email notifications, book a calendar meeting, or email me directly, then I also collect your email address for the purposes of completing the requested interaction.

I do not store these emails directly, but rely on the services of third-party providers with GDPR compliant privacy policies, specifically:
* Email subscriptions are managed and email addresses stored by [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com) under their [privacy policy](https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/privacy-policy) - this does include the use of web beacons in emails sent to track open rates.
* Calendar bookings are managed by [ZCal](https://zcal.co/), [privacy policy](https://zcal.co/privacy).
* I use [Google Workspace](https://www.google.com/workspace) as my email provider - your email will end up in a Google product, protected by their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-NZ) when you email or book a meeting with me.

## Terms of Use

I offer this site to you on a best-effort, no obligation, no warranty basis.

While I try my best to publish honest, useful writing, I make no guarantee that any information is accurate, free from mistake, or suitable for use in your context.
