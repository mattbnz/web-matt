Discuss the pros/cons of start-up style swing big vs bootstrapping.



My experience to date from the school deployment and subsequent testing with friends and family is that achieving sustainable unit cost economics is feasible at the software and hardware levels. If we ignore the initial sunk cost of my time developing the business to this stage and consider only ongoing effort required, each new monitor and customer I add from now on will be  profitable, requiring little ongoing maintenance or support, and this remains true even at fairly discounted prices compared to the other options in the market.

I do value my time, and do not plan to ignore it in practice, but separating the underlying economics of sustaining existing customers from the one-off investment or series of investments used to build and grow the business provides two useful things. First it forces me to build in a way that maintains the profitable unit-cost economics and low overheads I am targeting. My goal is that even with small numbers of customers and low growth rates I can continue to offer a profitable and useful service to existing customers with little to no further time investment. Secondly it means that when considering each project or effort to grow the business that I could invest time into, I am not forced to feel the need to do it to sustain the business, but can decide whether or not to do it based on the expected benefits compared to the opportunity cost of not pursuing other projects or businesses I could be investing time into instead.

You could call this the slow and steady wins the race strategy â€“ I think it has promise for making progress in a situation where the target market has low awareness of the problem you are trying to solve. It allows a useful level of value and service to be continually delivered, while enabling iteration and experiments to stimulate additional demand and growth to take place as and when the situation and environment makes them attractive, rather than on a time frame forced by burn rate and need to demonstrate a rapid return on capital invested. The risk that its the wrong strategy and a more startup-like approach with better funding and staffing would have a higher change of succeeding remains, but I'm comfortable taking a bet on that, and I think the slow and steady strategy is a better fit with my overall goals and approach.
