Hi!

After nearly 7 years of dormancy, I'm rebooting this website and have a goal to write regularly on a variety of topics going forward. More on that and my goals in a coming post...

For now, this is just a placeholder note to help double-check that everything on the new site is working as expected and the letters are flowing through the "pipes" in the right places.

## Technical Details

I've migrated the site from Wordpress, to a fully static configuration using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for help with styling.

For now hosting is still on a [Linode VM](https://linode.com) in Fremont, CA, but my plan is to move to a more specialized static hosting service with better CDN reach in the very near future.

If you want to inspect the innards further, it's all at https://github.com/mattbnz/web-matt.

## Still on the TODO list

 * Improve the hosting situation as noted above.
 * Integrate Bert Hubert's nice [audience minutes](https://github.com/berthubert/audience-minutes) analytics script.
 * Write up (or find) LinkedIn/Twitter/Mastodon integration scripts to automatically post updates when a new piece of writing appears on the site, to build/notify followers and improve the social reach. Ideally, the script would then also update the page here with links to the thread(s), so that readers can easily join/follow any resulting conversation on the platform of their choice. I'm not planning to add any direct comment or feedback functinoality on the site itself.
 * Add a newsletter/subscription option for folks who don't use RSS and would prefer updates via email rather than a social feed.
