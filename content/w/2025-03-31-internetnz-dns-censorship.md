InternetNZ is the incorporated society that runs the .nz namespace. I've been a member for many years. I also had the privilege of serving on the review panel that advised on changes to the rules governing how .nz is operated at the last major review in 2019. It's an organisation I feel some ownership in, and care about the future of.

The .nz ccTLD is well regarded internationally. The model of taking profits earned from domain registration fees to fund projects and programmes that benefit the growth and development of the Internet in New Zealand has served both the organisation and the country well over the past decades. Perhaps due to this, the reality has long been that most kiwis don't know the organisation exists and the number of members has remained stubbornly low.

In the last few months that membership has dramatically changed.

The changes are ostensibly because of concerns raised about a proposed new constitution for the society. I think those concerns are misplaced and while the new constitution is not perfect, I am in favour of it's adoption, and I hope to see it pass at today's SGM.

While I think the concerns about the constitution itself misplaced, and being driven by organisations with questionable motives, that doesn't mean that the issues themselves are not worthy of discussion.

I want to explore some thoughts around both the role of InternetNZ and DNS Censorship more generally.


## Recent History

But first a quick pointer to some recent history.
* Chch shooting -> emergency provision
* Systemic racism review
* Conflicted domains proposal
* Last week's AT parking articles

There are clear examples of growing pressure from at least some quarters for more active enforcement of content.


## DNS Censorship

* No concern for use is a good policy
* DNS is almost always the wrong layer to be performing take-downs at
* Requiring valid registration details is an excellent middle-ground policy
* The existing policy should be made stronger, more pushed back on registrars.
* Combine with a trusted notifier regime for lawful takedowns backed by the courts.

InternetNZ should operate all this as it always historically has on the DNS side of the house.


## Dual Roles

But InternetNZ has always had a dual role. No concern for use on the registry side, but a broader more equity and social benefit approach on the side that distributes and uses the gains that the registry has earned. I don't think there's anything wrong with that per se. It's always been a difficult balance and the organisation has a strong history of balancing it well, but it does rely on trust and social license.

Perhaps it's time to give up the dual role. The Internetn doesn't really need the promotion and advocacy today that it did 20 years ago. The issues of the day, the ones causing all the heat, are broader than the technolgoy and reflect society itself. The succcess of the Internet at impacting ever aspect of our lives is precisely why the dual role is perhaps less tenable today than it was at the founding. InternetNZ can't fix society.

A thinner registry could significantly drop registration fees, increasing access and enabling new use-cases (personal identity, etc). It's not without benefits, but losing the grants and policy side would not be without cost either.


## Food for thought

I feel strongly that "no concern for use" and the current policy is right, good and proper and must continue. That's absolutely my starting position and framing world-view. I'm less convinced that drawing a line from that to dropping the grants and policy side is absolutely the right answer, but it was surprising to see how little objections to it I could come up with.
