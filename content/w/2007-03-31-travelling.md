In just a few hours, I&#8217;m hopping on Emirates flight EK433 from Auckland to Singpore, to start the first leg of my trip to Dublin. I&#8217;ll be travelling for pretty much the next month, so if you&#8217;re trying to get hold of me please don&#8217;t be offended if I take several days to reply. 

Kat and I have setup another blog to detail our travels, and I&#8217;ll try and keep this blog free of too much personal stuff so as to not clutter the various planets that it is syndicated to. If you&#8217;re interested in our travels and what we are up to then head over to [http://www.mattandkatbrown.com][1].

There is also a calendar at mattandkatbrown.com if you&#8217;re wanting to try and meet up with me for keysigning, etc.
