A new year is upon us! [My plan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattbrown_last-saturday-april-30th-was-my-15th-googleversary-activity-6927072668626157568-M7Z3) was to be 6 months into the journey of starting my own business by this point.

I did makee some tentative progress towards that goal in 2022, registering a company and starting some consulting work, but on the whole despite many best intentions I've found it much harder than expected to gather the necessary motivation and energy to begin that journey in earnest.

I need to do better, so I'm going to take the example of a couple of people I respect (my friend Nat, and Will Larson) who write wonderful annual goal reviews. I've always enjoyed reading these and already the basic act of just writing down and articulating my motivations and goals has been incredibly useful to clarify my thoughts and create some tangible next steps.

I hope that by also publishing this, you too might find it interesting, and the additional public accountability it creates will be a positive encouragement to me. I'd certainly love to hear your input and feedback!

If you want the TL;DR you can skip [straight to the goals](#2023-goals), or keep reading to dive into my thought process for arriving at them.


## Reflection

The struggle for motivation and energy over the last half of 2022 has been frustrating. I want to get started on my business journey! But on the positive side, it's given me plenty of time to reflect on the first chapters of my career, draw some lessons I wish I'd learnt sooner and gather some clarity about how I want to move forward.

### The importance of purpose

My struggles of 2022 didn't come from nowhere. I'd been increasingly unhappy at Google for a number of years. I blamed it on a series of situations and challenges that arose, some in my control, some not. Regardless of their source, as someone in a relatively senior leadership position, it felt right to continue investing time and energy into trying to deliver successful outcomes despite the circumstances, after all isn't that how we grow?

With the benefit of time and distance, I've realised the increasing unhappiness was actually not about the situations themselves, or my perceived success in them, but was a symptom of having lost alignment between what fundamentally energizes me as a person and the goals and objectives I was pursuing.

The most fulfilling and happiest times of my career, have been when I've been able to link my work back to a bigger purpose and concrete positive impact in the world. Prior to Google that was through open source contributions and connecting underserved rural communities with wireless broadband. For the first two thirds of my Google career, I really did feel like my work was enabling and supporting Google's altruistic mission of making information universally accessible and useful.

In the last 4-5 years at Google, my ability to see a link to a bigger purpose or positive impact in the world has been tenuous at best. But given the lure of continued career growth and associated benefits, plus a genuine love and appreciation for the many awesome people I worked with, it was easy to ignore the niggling doubts and keep going.

A wiser and more self aware individual might have realised the futility of continuing to expend such energy without a balancing source to replenish it. It's not like this is a novel revelation after all. But even if it took an underwhelming end to an otherwise amazing experience and 9 months of frustrating contemplation to get there, I'm grateful to have finally learned this basic lesson.

I know that going forward, I must always maintain that link from my work to a a bigger purpose and concrete positive impact in the world, because it is what provides me energy and motivation to push through the inevitable challenges that will occur, and I need to be willing to leave any job or situation when I can't find that link any more.

### The importance of community

Unlike many I've always enjoyed office life, working remotely has never been my preference, but when we moved back to NZ in 2016 I rationalized it as a cost I was willing to bear to keep the benefits of continuing to work with people I loved on projects that were interesting to me at the time.

By early 2020 I was aware that cost/benefit equation was no longer balancing as I had hoped and articulated, but how much of that was down to me, and how much was down to trying to be a square peg in the round hole of Google's office centric culture was not obvious. When the pandemic forced everyone home, and brought the opportunity to try a different team with it, I jumped at the chance in the hope the leveled playing field would make a difference.

It didn't and I think it's clear now that much of the struggles I've experienced with remote work is down to my personality and approach. While I can project a confident and extroverted exterior in situations where I'm already well established, or experiencing significant support/sponsorship, I've come to realise I'm not at all skilled at reaching out and building or maintaining relationships beyond my direct scope of effort, and after 6 years of working remotely without the benefit of chance hallway meetings and other social supports to supplement that I feel like my professional network is more isolated than ever.

### Moving Forward

My key take-aways to bring into the next chapter of my career are:

1. I need to be able to clearly and robustly articulate how my work is leaving a positive impact on the world.
1. I need to explicitly focus on building relationships and being part of a community - it's not going to just happen naturally for me.

Additionally, I highly value:
 * Impact - lots.
 * Independence - control of direction/strategy.
 * Community - .
 * Financial reward - stewardship.

So, let's take that and try and articulate the vision, mission, strategy and goals that are going to drive me going forward.


## Vision

**Software systems make a positive and meaningful contribution to improving life in all aspects, but particularly in helping to drive a change in direction of our planet's climate indicators.**

Software technology is an amazing force multiplier that has significant additional potential to help address many of the problems we face as a species, but like all technology, it's not a given that positive outcomes will directly result from the application of software technology to any particular problem, we have to be intentional and careful about how we apply it to ensure all stakeholders experience positive outcomes and the expected impact is meaningfully realised.

Of all the problems that can be addressed with software technology, climate change is the most pressing and motivating to me to focus on. We're at an inflection point in history, where it's crucial we achieve a directional change in key climate indicators such as atmospheric CO2, and while that's going to take significant changes throughout society as a whole to achieve, software can play a crucial enabling role to support the larger change.

## Mission

**To develop software systems with positive and meaningful impacts on their communities of stakeholders while also contributing, supporting and helping to develop technology communities and the individuals within them.**

## Strategy

Meaningfully contributing to the scope of the mission will require multiple years of commitment and execution through ups and downs, necessitating a strategy that balances across what I think I've identified as four factors that significantly impact my overall happiness and fufillment in my professional life:
 * Impact.
 * Independence.
 * Community.
 * Financial reward.

Putting all this together, I think the right approach for me is to build my own business with a structure that enables me to undertake a mixture of consulting and product development work.

Testing this strategy against the most obvious alternatives, why don't I:
 * Take a senior level role in an existing company with an aligned vision and mission, with the obvious potential upside of achieving significantly higher levels of impact sooner, than I'll be able to achieve starting from scratch on my own. I haven't found, and nor do I think I'm likely to find such a role which gives the level of independence/control that I think will serve my goals above.
 * Commit to pursuing a single idea or opportunity in depth, rather than spreading my time between consulting and product development. I definitely haven't ruled this out, but I don't think now is the right time - I don't have an idea or product that I feel sufficiently passionate about to be willing to commit solely to yet. I may very well come back to this, if, or hopefully when the right idea presents itself through my other product development or consulting work.

## 2023 Goals

To put that strategy into action this year, I'm going to focus on three specific goals for my business:

1. Build awareness of my consulting offering and develop a pipeline of opportunities and engagements that provide a baseline of revenue and exposure to interesting problems in a variety of domains and contexts.

2. Explore several software product ideas in my areas of interest and develop at least two ideas to MVP stage with customer feedback received, and at least one product launched with a growing revenue stream.

3. Develop and maintain a broad professional network.

### Consulting

I see consulting as a useful way to earn a baseline revenue stream while also providing the opportunity to work with a variety of clients and their respective business problems. Based on my background and experience, I plan to target my consulting across three areas:

1. Leadership - building and growing operationally focused software SRE/devops teams. Drawing on my experiences building strong SRE teams, a typical engagement may involve helping a client establish to a new SRE/devops practice, or to develop and strengthen the structure and processes in their existing team.

2. Architecture - applying deep technical expertise to the design of large software systems, particularly focusing on their reliability and operability. A typical engagement may involve providing design input and decision making support on key aspects of a new system, or offering external review and advice of an existing design.

3. Technology Strategy - translating high-level business needs into appropriate technical roadmaps and understandable explanations of how software can help, and an iterative series of appropriate sized projects to drive implementation. A typical customer for this would be a small to medium sized business outside of the software industry with a desire to use software in a transformative way to improve their business but lacking the necessary in-house expertise to drive the transition.

I expect to spend around half my time on consulting projects, with areas 1 and 2 likely to involve shorter project based engagements for a wider number of clients and area 3 requiring a longer-term ongoing relationship with a smaller set of clients.

### Product Development

As much as I'm looking forward to the variety of problems and businesses that consulting work can expose me to, I ultimately aim to have an impact that scales beyond the direct hours that I invest in my work, which means building products and the business model supporting them that can scale beyond me and my direct involvement.

As noted above, I want to explore a range of different opportunities and ideas over the year, but there are 3 particular areas that I am passionate about and want to pay particular attention to:

1. Decarbonisation through electrification. NZ is well positioned to drive significant carbon reductions over the next 10 years by electrifying significant portions of our current energy usage, but achieving that potential requires significant transformation and change, particularly in our electricity industry. NZ's electricity system fascinates me, it's a classic complex, distributed system and the challenges of dealing with a greater number of players and dynamic behaviour driven by the entrance of further renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DER) presents huge needs and opportunities for software systems to enable and support the change. There's lots of conversations happening across the industry, and it feels like there are big opportunities in this space.

2. Farm management SaaS. It's potentially a crowded space, with a number of existing applications and tools already on offer, but typically owned and developed by a particular vendor, supplier or organisation and from what I can gather not hugely interoperable. In parallel the information required from and the compliance tasks expected of farmers is increasing. I'd like to explore whether there's demand for a top-level tool that focuses first and foremost on supporting efficiency in day to day farm management tasks, helps to drive overall productivity analysis and improvements, and can reduce or eliminate the need for farmers to interact with or spend time on supplier or organisation specific tasks.

3. Air Quality Monitoring. I started co2mon.nz to support monitoring at our local school, but I still see a large unmet need in many offices, retail shops, restaurants and other indoor public spaces for ventilation monitoring to support air quality improvements. While we're all tired of Covid and wish it were over, I firmly believe we're still only in the early stages of seeing the long-term legacy of this pandemic and improved indoor ventilation should be one of those. co2mon.nz is already past the MVP stage on the software side, the challenge for me here will be whether I can scale the hardware needed to support the business in a reliable and sustainable way. I'm not willing to go all in on it, but as a side project I think there's still further room to explore.

The major risk I need to manage in this space is time and trying to do too much in too many areas at once and balancing time between consulting and product development. I don't have a fully coherent plan for how to address this yet, but broadly speaking it's clear the answer is that I'll need to bring in additional people to drive any product that goes beyond an initial MVP stage - likely via contracting out specific development, customer support or business process tasks as an initial step.


### Developing my professional network

Breaking out of the bad habits I've developed in this space is important both for my general happiness and well being, but is also fundamentally necessary from a marketing and awareness perspective - I'm not going to develop a pipeline of consulting work, or meet potential partners and collaborators to develop products with if I'm not out there visibly, and reguarly interacting with others in my professional sphere.

I'm setting myself 2 goals in this space:

1. To build professional relationship with at least 30 new people this year, meaning that we've met and had a decent conversation at least a couple of times and keep in touch at least every few months in some form.

2. To publish at least once a week a piece of writing on this site that generates interesting conversations and feedback. I'll use this as an opportunity to explore product ideas, highlight my consulting expertise and generally contribute interesting technical content into the world.

3. To help build and grow the local technical community by sharing my experience and knowledge with others on a voluntary basis, e.g. mentoring,
