I've often been inspired by annual review/goal posts, such as those from Lethain and Nat, so as I reboot this website I'm going to take an attempt at following their example and articulate some goals I hope to accomplish over the next year and beyond. My intention is to solict feedback and to create a modicum of public accountability for myself, while also reserving my right to iterate and evolve these goals as time progresses.

## Context

2022 was a challenging year for me professionally. My happiness at Google had been declining for several years, and despite trying a couple of fresh opportunities and teams over the course of 2020 and 2021 by early 2022 it was abundantly clear to me that the fundamental issue was that my values and goals no longer aligned with what Google could offer me. I left at the end of April, precisely 15 years after I started.

On the whole, Google was an fantastic phase of my career and life, for which I'm incredibly grateful. I gained immense experience in both leadership and technical realms, made wonderful friends and memories while experiencing all the benefits and perks of working at a tech giant through the peak of an industry boom. For the majority of the time it was a dream job that I was proud of, if I could teach my former self one thing, it would be to have had the courage to leave several years ago, at the peak of my happiness.

I knew I needed some time to clear my head before jumping into something else, so I planned to take 3 months to work around our farm before starting something new. In reality, 3 months turned in 6, and while I had a lot of exciting ideas floating around in my head, I found myself struggling to execute on them and the next thing I knew it's December!

While it often felt like I was getting nothing done in 2022, objectively, there were some key milestones:
* I incorporated MKMBA Ltd as an entity for my consulting and professional work going forward.
* I built a set of CO2 monitors for my kids school, and developed co2mon.nz as a web service to monitor and maintain them. I took tentative steps to explore turning co2mon.nz into a larger business. I think there's still a massive need in the market for air quality monitoring to become accessible to all homes, businesses and indoor spaces. But I let worries about whether I had sufficient hardware expertise to support the product, and a lack of enthusiasm for the marketing and education work likely to be required to drive sales in a mostly apathetic customer base hold me back from fully committing to this project.
* I was elected onto the Board of Trustees for my kids school.


## "Where do you see yourself in 5 years"?

As much as it is a cliched career coaching question, I do find it a helpful framing to think about and articulate what I want out of the next phase of my career.

* I want to own and lead a successful business that's making a positive impact on the world.
* I want to be recognized as a leader in my field with a reputation for working with integrity and helping others.
