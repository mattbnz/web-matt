A new year is upon us! [My plan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattbrown_last-saturday-april-30th-was-my-15th-googleversary-activity-6927072668626157568-M7Z3) was to be 6 months into the journey of starting a business by this point.

I made some very tentative progress towards that goal in 2022, registering a company and starting some consulting work, but on the whole I've found it much harder than expected to gather the necessary energy to begin that journey in earnest.

I need to do better, so I'm going to take the example of a couple of people I respect (my friend Nat, and Will Larson) who write wonderful annual goal reviews. I've always enjoyed reading these and already the basic act of just writing down and articulating my motivations and goals has been incredibly useful to clarify my thoughts and create some tangible next steps.

I hope that by also publishing this, you too might find it interesting, and the additional public accountability it creates will be a positive encouragement to me. I'd certainly love to hear your input and feedback!

If you want the TL;DR you can skip [straight to the goals](#2023-goals), or keep reading for a (much) more detailed explanation of my thought process.


## Reflection

I'm excited about the next chapter of my career, so the fact that I've been struggling to get started has been frustrating. The only upside is that the delay has given me plenty of time to reflect on the last few years and what I can learn from them and draw some lessons to help better manage and sustain my energy going forward.

### Purpose

A large part of what I've realized is that I should have left Google years ago. It was a great place to work, and I'm incredibly grateful for everything I learned and received during my time there. For years it was my dream job, but my happiness had been declining, and instead of taking the (relatively small) risk of leaving to the unknown, I tried several variations of team and role in the hope of restoring the dream.

The reality is that a significant chunk of my motivation and energy comes from being able to link my work back to a bigger purpose that delivers concrete positive impact in the world. I felt that link through Google's mission to make information universally accessible and useful for the first 10-11 years, but for the latter 4-5 years my ability to see that link was tenuous at best and trying to push through the challenges presented without that link providing a reliable source of energy is what drove my unhappiness and led to needing a longer break to recharge.

I expect the challenges of starting a business to be even greater than what I experienced at Google, so the lessson I'm taking from this is that it's crucial for me to understand what the link between my work and the bigger purpose with concrete positive impact in the world that I'm aiming to contribute to is.

### Community

The second factor that I've slowly come to realise has been missing from my career in the last few years has been participation in a professional community and a variety of enriching interpersonal relationships. As much as I value and need this type of interaction, fostering and sustaining it unfortunately doesn't come naturally to me. Working remotely since 2016 and then taking a 9 month break out of the industry are not particularly helpful contributors to building and maintaining a wide network either!

The lesson here is simply that I'm going to need to push past my comfort zone in reaching out and introducing myself to a range of people in order to grow my professional network, and equally I need to be diligent and disciplined in making time to maintain and regularly connect with people whom I respect and find energizing to interact with.

### Personal Influences

Lastly, I've been reflecting on a set of principles that are important to me. These are not so much new lessons, more confirming to myself what I value moving forward. There are many things I could include here, but to keep it somewhat brief, the key influences on my thinking are:

* Independence - I can't entirely explain why or where it comes from, but since the start of my professional career (which I consider to be my consulting/freelancing development during high school) I've understood that I'm far more motivated by building and growing my own business than I am by working for someone else. Working for myself has always felt like the default and sensible course - I'm excited to get back to that. I do worry that I'm limiting, or at least delaying, my potential impact vs joining an existing effort whose purpose I can identify with, but the tradeof feels worthwhile to me to have the opportunity to build a business from scratch.

* Openness - Open is better than closed, in terms of software, business model and organisational processes. This continues to be a strong belief and something I want to uphold in my business endeavours. Competition should be based on superior technical quality or service, not artificial constraints or barriers to entry that lock customers and users into a single solution or market. Protocols and networks should be open for wide participation and easily acceesible to new entrants and competition.

* People first - This applies both to how we work with each other - respectfully, valuing diversity and with integrity, and to how we apply technology to our world - with consideration for all stakeholders it may affect and awareness of both the intendend and potential unintented impacts.


## Framework

Using [Vision, Mission and Strategy](https://www.aha.io/blog/vision-vs-mission-vs-strategy) as a planning framework has worked quite well for me when building and growing teams over the years, so I plan to re-use it personally to help organise the above reflections into a hopefully cohesive plan than results in some useful 2023 goals.

I consider this a first draft, which I intend to revise and evolve further over the next 6-12 months. I don't plan major changes to the intent or underlying ideas, but finding the best words to express and convey that intent clearly is not something I expect to get right on the first take.


### Vision

**Software systems contribute direct and meaningful impact to solving real problems in our world.**

Each word has a fair bit of meaning behind it for me, so breaking it down a little bit:

* software - excites me because it is still [eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and has significant potential to do good.
* systems - reminds me that as well as usually being a complex system in its own right, software also exists as part of the complex system that is our modern world.
* contribute - follows from being part of a system. Software alone doesn't solve problems, and misapplied can easily make things worse. To contribute software needs to be designed and evaluated intentionally and with an awareness of risks it could pose.
* direct and meaningful impact - means I'm not looking for broad outcomes like improving productivity or communication, which apply generally across many problems. I want to see software applied to solve specific blockers whose removal makes a significant impact on the problem.
* real problems - as opposed to straightforward problems. The types of issue where the acknowledgement of it as a "real problem" often ends the sentence as it feels too big to tackle. Climate change and pandemic risk are examples of real problems. Decentralizing finance or selling more widgets are not.
* in our world - is mostly filler to round out the sentence nicely, but I do think we should probably sort out the mess we're making on our own planet before trying to colonize anywhere else.


### Mission

**To lead the development and operation of software systems that deliver new opportunities for individuals, businesses and communities to participate in solving the real problems in their community.**

Again breaking down the intent a little bit:

* lead - having meaningful impact on real problems is a big job I won't succeed at as a one man band. It will require building and growing a larger team.
* development and operation - hints that the software systems we need don't always yet exist and need to be developed, but further that even post development the ongoing operation and integration of those software systems into their broader social and human systems of our world is a much more important and ongoing need.
* new opportunities - (including improvements to existing proceses) are important to drive and motivate investment in the adoption of technology. Building or operating a system that maintains the status quo is not motivating for me.
* individuals, businesses and communities - essentially everyone, but highlighting that focus on specific groups who will at different times assume roles as customers, users or stakeholders of a system and who will each have diverse needs is key to ensuring the system achieves the desired contribution and impact.
* participate - real problems often inspire or result in lack of action due to the scale of the challenge. Software systems scale easily, offering the potential to enable participation as a small part of a larger whole.
* their community - refines the ambition from the vision to an achievable scope of action within which to execute the mission. We won't solve our problems by targeting one big global fix, but if we each participate in solving the problems in our community collectively it will make a difference.

### Strategy

**Build a sustainable business that provides a home and infrastructure to support the development, validation and growth of software systems fulfilling the mission and vision above.**
* Accumulate meaningful impact via a portfolio of systems rather than one big bet.
* Focus on opportunities that promote the decarbonisation of our economy (the most pressing problem our society faces), but not at the expense of ignoring compelling opportunities to contribute impact to other real problems also.
* Favour the marathon over the sprint - while being first can be fun and convey benefits, it's often the fast-followers who learn from the intial mistakes and deliver lasting change and broader impact.

I'm not going to write a lot here about the rationale for this strategy. Firstly because I can't do so briefly, and secondly because I don't think the rationale is critically important. Strategy is relatively easy to adapt and change, and I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I have the runway and freedom to give this a go, and then course correct or pivot if I realise its not working or completely the wrong approach.

With that said, in keeping with the final bullet point, I aim to evaluate the strategy against a long-term view of success. What excites me about it is that it has the potential to provide structure and clarity for my work while also enabling multiple options future paths - from operating a portfolio of micro-SaaS products that each solve real problems for a specific niche or community, diving deep into a single compelling opportunity for a year or two, joining with others to partner on shared ventures or some combination of all three and variations in between.

## 2023 Goals

Taking the above long-term strategy and focusing on 2023, my specific strategy for the year is to bootstrap the business by offering my existing skills and experiences as a consultant while also allocating time to gaining experience with product development by exploring some existing product ideas I'm excited about.

That leads to three specific goals I intend to focus on in 2023:

1. Execute a series of successful consulting engagements, earning sufficient revenue to bootstrap the business while also leaving happy customers willing to provide testimonials that support a pipeline of future opportunities.

2. Grow my product development skillset by taking several ideas to MVP stage with customer feedback received, and launch at least one product which generates revenue and has growth potential.

3. Develop and maintain a broad professional network.


### Consulting

In addition to being a source of revenue, I'm excited about the potential to learn and explore a variety of businesses and problem spaces through consulting engagements. Based on my background and experience, I plan to target my consulting across three areas:

1. Leadership - building and growing operationally focused software SRE/devops teams. A typical engagement may involve helping a client establish to a new SRE/devops practice, or to develop and strengthen the structure and processes in their existing team.

2. Architecture - applying deep technical expertise to the design of large software systems, particularly focusing on their reliability and operability. A typical engagement may involve providing design input and decision making support on key aspects of a new system, or offering external review and advice of an existing design.

3. Technology Strategy - translating high-level business needs into appropriate technical roadmaps and understandable explanations of how software can help, and an iterative series of appropriate sized projects to drive implementation. A typical customer for this would be a small to medium sized business outside of the software industry with a desire to use software in a transformative way to improve their business but lacking the necessary in-house expertise to drive the transition.


### Product Development

The intial product ideas I'd like to explore include:

1. Decarbonisation through electrification. NZ is well positioned to drive significant carbon reductions over the next 10 years by electrifying significant portions of our current energy usage, but achieving that potential requires significant transformation and change, particularly in our electricity industry. NZ's electricity system fascinates me, it's a classic complex, distributed system and the challenges of dealing with a greater number of players and dynamic behaviour driven by the entrance of further renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DER) presents huge needs and opportunities for software systems to enable and support the change. There's lots of conversations happening across the industry, and it feels like there are big opportunities in this space.

2. Farm management SaaS. It's potentially a crowded space, with a number of existing applications and tools already on offer, but typically owned and developed by a particular vendor, supplier or organisation and from what I can gather not hugely interoperable. In parallel the information required from and the compliance tasks expected of farmers is increasing. I'd like to explore whether there's demand for a top-level tool that focuses first and foremost on supporting efficiency in day to day farm management tasks, helps to drive overall productivity analysis and improvements, and can reduce or eliminate the need for farmers to interact with or spend time on supplier or organisation specific tasks.

3. Air Quality Monitoring. I started co2mon.nz to support monitoring at our local school, but I still see a large unmet need in many offices, retail shops, restaurants and other indoor public spaces for ventilation monitoring to support air quality improvements. While we're all tired of Covid and wish it were over, I firmly believe we're still only in the early stages of seeing the long-term legacy of this pandemic and improved indoor ventilation should be one of those. co2mon.nz is already past the MVP stage on the software side, the challenge for me here will be whether I can scale the hardware needed to support the business in a reliable and sustainable way. I'm not willing to go all in on it, but as a side project I think there's still further room to explore.


### Developing my professional network

Breaking out of the bad habits I've developed in this space is important both for my general happiness and well being, but is also fundamentally necessary from a marketing and awareness perspective - I'm not going to develop a pipeline of consulting work, or meet potential partners and collaborators to develop products with if I'm not out there visibly, and reguarly interacting with others in my professional sphere.

I'm setting myself 3 sub-goals in this space:

1. To build professional relationship with at least 30 new people this year, meaning that we've met and had a decent conversation at least a couple of times and keep in touch at least every few months in some form.

2. To publish at least once a week a piece of writing on this site that generates interesting conversations and feedback. I'll use this as an opportunity to explore product ideas, highlight my consulting expertise and generally contribute interesting technical content into the world.

3. To help build and grow the local technical community by sharing my experience and knowledge with others on a voluntary basis, e.g. mentoring,
