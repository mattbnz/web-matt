A new year is upon us! [My plan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattbrown_last-saturday-april-30th-was-my-15th-googleversary-activity-6927072668626157568-M7Z3) was to be 6 months into the journey of starting a business by this point.

I made some very tentative progress towards that goal in 2022, registering a company and starting some consulting work, but on the whole I've found it much harder than expected to gather the necessary energy to begin that journey in earnest.

I need to do better, so I'm going to draw from the example of a couple of people ([my friend Nat](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/717), and [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/2022-in-review/)) whose annual review posts I've always enjoyed and attempt something similar.

Already the basic act of just writing down and articulating my motivations and goals has been incredibly useful to clarify my thoughts and create some tangible next steps. I hope that by also publishing this, you too might find it interesting, and the additional public accountability it creates will be a positive encouragement to me. I'd certainly love to hear your input and feedback!

Following the goals themselves, I've also included the [reflections](#reflection) that I used to craft a [vision](#vision), [mission](#mission) and [strategy](#strategy) to guide the next phase of my career.

## 2023 Goals

My focus for 2023 is to bootstrap the business I plan to use to execution my [mission](#mission) through three goals:

1. Execute a series of successful consulting engagements, building a reputation for myself and leaving happy customers willing to provide testimonials that support a pipeline of future opportunities.

2. Grow my product development skill set by taking several ideas to MVP stage with customer feedback received, and launch at least one product which generates revenue and has growth potential.

3. Develop and maintain a broad professional network.


### Consulting

I'm keen to balance my time between consulting and product development, because I see consulting as a mechanism by which to learn more about and explore a variety of businesses and problem spaces while delivering value to those engaging me. Based on my background and experience, I plan to target my consulting across three areas:

1. Leadership - building and growing operationally focused software teams following SRE/devops principles. A typical engagement may involve helping a client establish to a new SRE/devops practice, or to develop and strengthen the structure and processes in their existing team.

2. Architecture - applying deep technical expertise to the design of large software systems, particularly focusing on their reliability and operability. A typical engagement may involve providing design input and decision making support on key aspects of a new system, or offering external review and advice of an existing design.

3. Technology Strategy - translating high-level business needs into appropriate technical roadmaps that provide understandable explanations of the value software can deliver in that context, and the iterative series of appropriately sized projects required to realise it. A typical customer for this would be a small to medium sized business outside of the software industry with a desire to use software in a transformative way to improve their business but who does not employ the necessary in-house expertise to lead that transition.


### Product Development

There are three, currently extremely high level, product ideas closely aligned to my chosen mission that I'm excited to explore:

1. Improve co-ordination of electricity resources to support and accelerate the electrification of NZ's energy needs and the transition to zero carbon grid.

    NZ has huge potential to be a world-leader in decarbonising energy use through electrification, but requires a massive transition to realise the benefits. Many of the challenges to that transition involve coordination of an order of magnitude more distributed energy resources (DER) in a much more dynamic and software-oriented manner than the electricity industry is traditionally experienced with. There's a huge gap of experience and expertise in building and operating such systems that needs to be bridged.

    So while the concept of improving DER coordination is hardly novel, I think the match between my experience with large, high-reliability distributed software systems, the need in the industry, and the current motivation towards finding solutions to enable a rapid transition to a zero carbon, highly electrified energy future for NZ, makes this a very compelling area to look for a more detailed product need and opportunity in.

1. Drive reduced agricultural emissions by making sustainable farm management, including compliance reporting, straightforward, fun and effective for busy farmers.

    NZ farmers are caught between two difficult forces. Agricultural emissions are NZ's biggest category and must come down. Programs to drive and incentive this behaviour (both existing, and upcoming) are increasing compliance and reporting burdens on already very busy farmers who don't have the time or inclination to provide similar data multiple times to different regulators and authorities. In tandem, rising business costs and constraints drive a need for continuous improvements in efficiency, performance and farm management processes increasing the complexity and amount of data farmers must work with.

    Many industry organisations and associated software players offer existing solutions aimed at addressing aspects of these problems, but anecdotal feedback indicates these are poorly integrated, little loved, piecemeal solutions that are often frustrating to use - a burden rather than a source of continuous improvement. It seems like there could be an opportunity for a delightful, comprehensive farm management and reporting system to disrupt the industry and support farmers to do what they do best, rather than being a burden.

1. Lower sickness rates and improve cognitive performance by enabling every indoor space to benefit from continuous ventilation monitoring and reporting.

    Indoor air quality is important in reducing disease transmission risk and promoting optimal cognitive performance, but despite the current pandemic temporarily raising its profile, a focus on indoor air quality generally remains under the radar for most people.

    One factor contributing to this is the lack of widely available systems for continuously monitoring and reporting on air quality. I built https://co2mon.nz/ to help address this problem in my children's school during 2022, and there is potential to further market and raise awareness of this capability for use in any indoor environment.

In addition to these mission aligned product ideas, I'm also interested in exploring the creation of small to medium sized SaaS applications that while not directly linked to solving a "real problem" in the world still deliver useful value by serving the needs of a specialized or niche business or industry. The development and operation of systems of this type can contribute to the mission by improving the sustainability of the business both through direct revenue contribution and by providing economies of scale in the many backend processes and infrastructure required to deliver secure, reliable and performant software systems.

### Developing my professional network

To help make this goal more actionable and measurable I've decided to break it into 3 sub goals:

1. To build professional relationship with at least 30 new people this year, meaning that we've met and had a decent conversation at least a couple of times and keep in touch at least every few months in some form.

2. To publish a piece of writing on this site at least once a week, and for many of those to generate interesting conversations and feedback. I'll use this as an opportunity to explore product ideas, highlight my consulting expertise and generally contribute interesting technical content into the world.

3. To support the growth of my local technical community by volunteering my experience and knowledge with others through activities such as mentoring, conference talks and similar.


## Reflection

I'm excited about the next chapter of my career, so the fact that I've been struggling to get started has been frustrating. The only upside is that the delay has given me plenty of time to reflect on the last few years and what I can learn from them and draw some lessons to help better manage and sustain my energy going forward.

### Purpose

A large part of what I've realized is that I should have left Google years ago. It was a great place to work, and I'm incredibly grateful for everything I learned and received during my time there. For years it was my dream job, but my happiness had been declining, and instead of taking the (relatively small) risk of leaving to the unknown, I tried several variations of team and role in the hope of restoring the dream.

The reality is that a significant chunk of my motivation and energy comes from being able to link my work back to a bigger purpose that delivers concrete positive impact in the world. I felt that link through Google's mission to make information universally accessible and useful for the first 10-11 years, but for the latter 4-5 years my ability to see that link was tenuous at best and trying to push through the challenges presented without that link providing a reliable source of energy is what drove my unhappiness and led to needing a longer break to recharge.

I expect the challenges of starting a business to be even greater than what I experienced at Google, so the lesson I'm taking from this is that it's crucial for me to understand what the link between my work and the bigger purpose with concrete positive impact in the world that I'm aiming to contribute to is.

### Community

The second factor that I've slowly come to realise has been missing from my career in the last few years has been participation in a professional community and a variety of enriching interpersonal relationships. As much as I value and need this type of interaction, fostering and sustaining it unfortunately doesn't come naturally to me. Working remotely since 2016 and then taking a 9 month break out of the industry are not particularly helpful contributors to building and maintaining a wide network either!

The lesson here is simply that I'm going to need to push past my comfort zone in reaching out and introducing myself to a range of people in order to grow my professional network, and equally I need to be diligent and disciplined in making time to maintain and regularly connect with people whom I respect and find energizing to interact with.

### Personal Influences

Lastly, I've been reflecting on a set of principles that are important to me. These are not so much new lessons, more confirming to myself what I value moving forward. There are many things I could include here, but to keep it somewhat brief, the key influences on my thinking are:

* Independence - I can't entirely explain why or where it comes from, but since the start of my professional career (which I consider to be my consulting/freelancing development during high school) I've understood that I'm far more motivated by building and growing my own business than I am by working for someone else. Working for myself has always felt like the default and sensible course - I'm excited to get back to that.

* Openness - Open is better than closed, in terms of software, business model and organisational processes. This continues to be a strong belief and something I want to uphold in my business endeavours. Competition should be based on superior technical quality or service, not artificial constraints or barriers to entry that lock customers and users into a single solution or market. Protocols and networks should be open for wide participation and easily accessible to new entrants and competition.

* People first - This applies both to how we work with each other - respectfully, valuing diversity and with integrity, and to how we apply technology to our world - with consideration for all stakeholders it may affect and awareness of both the intended and potential unintended impacts.


## Framework

Using [Vision, Mission and Strategy](https://www.aha.io/blog/vision-vs-mission-vs-strategy) as a planning framework has worked quite well for me when building and growing teams over the years, so I plan to re-use it personally to help organise the above reflections into a hopefully cohesive plan than results in some useful 2023 goals.

I consider this a first draft, which I intend to revise and evolve further over the next 6-12 months. I don't plan major changes to the intent or underlying ideas, but finding the best words to express and convey that intent clearly is not something I expect to get right on the first take.


### Vision

**Software systems contribute direct and meaningful impact to solving real problems in our world.**

Each word has a fair bit of meaning behind it for me, so breaking it down a little bit:

* software - excites me because it is still [eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and has significant potential to do good.
* systems - to reminds me that as well as being a complex system in its own right, software also exists as part of the complex system that is our modern world.
* contribute - follows from being part of a system. Software alone doesn't solve problems, and misapplied can easily make things worse. To contribute software needs to be designed intentionally and evaluated with an awareness of risks it could pose.
* direct and meaningful impact - I'm not looking for broad outcomes like improving productivity or communication, which apply generally across many problems. I want to see software applied to solve specific blockers whose removal makes unlocks significant progress towards solving a problem.
* real - as opposed to straightforward problems. The types of issue where the acknowledgement of it as a "real problem" often ends the sentence as it feels too big to tackle. Climate change and pandemic risk are examples of real problems. Decentralizing finance or selling more widgets are not.
* in our world - is mostly filler to round out the sentence nicely, but I do think we should probably sort out the mess we're making on our own planet before trying to colonize anywhere else.


### Mission

**To lead the development and operation of software systems that deliver new opportunities for individuals, businesses and communities to solve the real problems in their community.**

Again breaking down the intent a little bit:

* lead - having meaningful impact on real problems is a big job. I won't succeed as a one man band. It will require building and growing a larger team.
* development and operation - development is fun and necessary, but I also wanted to highlight that the ongoing operation and integration of those software systems into the broader social and human systems of our world is an equally important and ongoing need.
* new opportunities - are important to drive and motivate investment in the adoption of technology. Building or operating a system that maintains the status quo is not motivating for me.
* individuals, businesses and communities - aka everyone! But each of these groups (as examples, not specific) will have diverse roles, needs and interactions with the software which must be considered to ensure the system achieves the desired contribution and impact.
* their community - refines the ambition from the vision to an achievable scope of action within which to execute the mission. We won't solve our problems by targeting one big global fix, but if we each participate in solving the problems in our community, collectively it will make a difference.

### Strategy

**Build a sustainable business that provides a home and infrastructure to support a continuous cycle of development, validation and growth of software systems fulfilling the mission and vision above.**
* Accumulate meaningful impact via a portfolio of systems rather than one big bet.
* Focus on opportunities that promote the decarbonisation of our economy (the most pressing problem our society faces), but not at the expense of ignoring compelling opportunities to contribute impact to other real problems also.
* Favour the marathon over the sprint - while being first can be fun and convey benefits, it's often the fast-followers who learn from the initial mistakes and deliver lasting change and broader impact.

I'm not going to write a lot here about the rationale for this strategy. Firstly because I can't do so briefly, and secondly because I don't think the rationale is critically important. Strategy is relatively easy to adapt and change, and I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I have the runway and freedom to give this a go, and then course correct or pivot if I realise its not working or completely the wrong approach.

With that said, in keeping with the final bullet point, I aim to evaluate the strategy against a long-term view of success. What excites me about it is that it has the potential to provide structure and clarity for my work while also enabling many future paths - from operating a portfolio of micro-SaaS products that each solve real problems for a specific niche or community, or diving deep into a single compelling opportunity for a year or two, joining with others to partner on shared ventures or some combination of all three and other variations in between.

## Next Steps
