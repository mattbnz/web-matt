Now that we&#8217;ve [settled into our new apartment][1] in Dublin, the ADSL has been connected and I&#8217;m back on the net! 

Obviously I&#8217;ve had Internet access at [work][2] during this time, but there has been so much new information to take in that I haven&#8217;t really had time to do any Debian or WLUG work.

I&#8217;m still waiting for the shipping company to deliver my computers, so it will be another week or two before I have a development environment that can build and test package. Once that&#8217;s setup again I have updates queued for the following:

  * PHPwiki &#8211; Upgrade to 1.3.13p1
  * libtrace &#8211; Upgrade to 3.0.2

Unfortunately I&#8217;m not going to make it to Debconf this year, despite being the closest geographically that I&#8217;ve ever been. üôÅ
