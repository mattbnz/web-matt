[co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) is a ventilation monitoring service, offering a web based dashboard for data provided by one or more physical monitors. I launched [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) in the middle of 2022 supporting monitors based on [Olive Seiler's open source design](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) and currently offer it as a free service to our local primary school, some local businesses and a few other individuals around NZ.

The importance of clean, fresh indoor air is one of the most tangible lessons we can learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Improving ventilation is not only one of the most effective risk mitigations for reducing the spread of Covid (and other respiratory illnesses), but also enables improved cognitive performance. Unfortunately air is invisible so much less attention and focus is directed towards this topic than it deserves.

I am passionate about the importance and value of ventilation monitoring for all indoor spaces, but I'm unable to see a compelling business model that would justify significant investment at the present time. My plan is to invest a small amount of time into co2mon.nz over 2023 with the aim of developing a sustainable revenue stream covering the infrastructure and base costs of the business.

## Ventilation Monitoring

The level of carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the air is one of the most effective measures of air quality. The atmospheric background level of CO2 is around 420 parts per million (ppm), while our exhaled breath has concentrations as high as 40,000 ppm. Without ventilation, one or more people breathing in an enclosed space will rapidly lead to an observable increase in CO2 concentration.

Measuring the concentration of CO2 in a space can be accurately and affordable achieved using a small electronic sensor based on NDIR technology, which (in a highly simplified explanation) beams infrared light of a particular frequency that happens to interact with CO2 molecules through a small chamber and measures the concentration based on the light received back.

Making the raw measurements provided by the sensor useful can be achieved in two ways:

* First, for immediate response and action (e.g. opening a window) by the occupants of the room we can pair the CO2 sensor with some coloured lights to provide a quick visual representation (green, orange, red) of the ventilation status of the room.

* Second, to support analysis of trends and strategic planning we can transmit and record the data over time in a service such as [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/). Based on this data we can plan long-term improvements in ventilation (e.g. install mechanical ventilation) or changes in behaviour (always leaving a window cracked open), which can keep the monitor in the green, without needing constant response actions by the occupants of a space.

## Backstory

Early last year as NZ abandoned its previous elimination strategy towards covid in the face of Omicron I became unhappy at the lack of attention being given to mitigation measures in NZ schools, and in particular the school that my children attend. As luck would have it, around this time I heard about Oliver Seiler's open source project to provide CO2 monitors to his children's school in Wellington and approached our school about doing the same - they were keen.

During May/June last year, I built and deployed 17 monitors to our school, and a few more to interested friends and family. To my mind, in addition to the direct visual guide to room occupants provided by the "traffic light" LEDs on Oliver's device, the key benefit of having a connected monitor is the ability to record and track patterns in CO2 levels over time, as that allows analysis of correlation between CO2 levels and room usage, ventilation status, and in turn planning and actions to be undertaken to achieve a useful and sustainable balance between ventilation and other needs such as heating and comfort.

But ongoing monitoring and reporting requires supporting infrastructure, for which the creation and maintenance of which is beyond the abilities of the typical NZ school - it's well within my capabilities to create, but in order to sustain and maintain, it felt to me like I needed a bit more scale than 17 monitors, so the idea of offerring co2mon.nz as a service was born.


### Blockers to progress

After getting the MVP up and running, it became clear that the biggest risk and blocker to further expansion was the provision of hardware itself. I was hand-soldering each monitor together via a mini assembly line in my workshed using 3D self-printed cases which is clearly not a sustainable process. I made some initial explorations of PCB assembly services, which turned up some promising options - even at surprisingly small batch sizes (e.g. 100 boards), but would still require a manual assembly step to install the completed PCB into the physical case, etc.


## Competitive space

There are a number of existing players in the CO2 monitoring space in New Zealand that I'm aware of:

  * Tether
  * Smooth Sensors
  * Monkeytronics
  * Aranet
  * Zigbee
