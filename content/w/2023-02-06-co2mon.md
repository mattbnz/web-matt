The importance of clean, fresh indoor air is one of the most tangible lessons we can learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Clean, fresh air is not only an incredibly effective risk mitigation for reducing the spread of coronaviruses (and other respiratory illnesses), but has always been important to enable effective cognitive performance.

Monitoring indoor air quality is relatively easy to do, but traditionally has not been a key focus for many of us. I started [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to support the monitoring of air quality in the classrooms of our local primary school and continue to provide it as a free service to the school, some local businesses and a few other individuals around NZ.

I believe air quality monitoring should be accessible to everyone for any indoor space, and for highly occupied indoor spaces should be provided on a continuous basis. In 2022, my first attempt at launching [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to improve the accessibility of indoor air quality monitoring revealed some problems with the intended business model which led me to pause further development. After careful reflection and planning, I'm going to try a second iteration of the business in 2023 as I believe there is still significant need and potential in this space.

Before diving into the details of that plan, I want to rewind and talk about:
* [Why ventilation is important to indoor air quality](#why-ventilation-is-important-to-indoor-air-quality)
* [CO2 is a useful proxy for ventilation](#co2-is-a-useful-proxy-for-ventilation)
* [Deciding to build another CO2 monitoring service](#deciding-to-build-another-co2-monitoring-service)
* [Lessons from iteration one](#lessons-from-iteration-one)
* [The challenge of building hardware](#the-challenge-of-building-hardware)
* [The plan for iteration two](#the-plan-for-iteration-two)

 I won't take offence if you want to skip straight to [the plan](#the-plan-for-iteration-two), but if you are interested in more context around why ventilation monitoring is important, and what I've learnt so far from the first iteration, then please keep reading.

## Why ventilation is important to indoor air quality

Indoor air quality can be a complex topic with many different variables to consider and balance. Temperature, humidity, particulate matter and the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2) all play a role in determining overall air quality. Other than temperature and humidity, most of these factors are not easily perceivable by occupants of a room until well after adverse effects or irritation occurs.

This complexity and the fact that air is invisible explain a large portion of why indoor air quality is often not considered - out of sight, out of mind.

In NZ we are blessed with relatively clean outdoor air and a temperate climate making simple ventilation of indoor spaces with fresh outdoor air an effective technique for improving and maintaining high levels of indoor air quality.

Natural Ventilation, simply opening a window or even better two windows on either side of a space even just slightly, is often sufficient to provide healthy levels of ventilation for a room, and indeed many (perhaps even most) NZ buildings are designed on this basis with natural ventilation assumed to be sufficient to keep the air clean, fresh and healthy. This is a viable strategy if the windows are indeed used as intended - but when air quality is not top of mind, reliance on opening windows for sufficient ventilation will often not work in practice, as windows are not opened early or often enough.

Mechanical ventilation, the provision of fresh outdoor air into a room via fans and ducts, provides a method of delivering fresh air into an indoor space that does not rely on occupants remembering to open windows. Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed specifically for each space to ensure they are sized to deliver sufficient volumes of fresh air for the size of the space and varying numbers of occupants. To perform effectively they also require ongoing maintenance to ensure that components such as filters a regularly cleaned, replaced and working as intended.

Both methods of ventilation have their uses, but regardless of how a space is ventilated, a missing component of the puzzle is how to have confidence that the ventilation method in use is working well and delivering adequate levels of clean, fresh air into the indoor environment.


## CO2 is a useful proxy for ventilation

While it is possible to purchase air quality monitors that report many different aspects of air quality, each additional sensor adds cost and complexity. To avoid this, the common method of monitoring and assessing indoor ventilation is to look simply at the level of CO2 present in the air.

CO2 provides a simple and effective measure of air quality due to the difference between our exhaled breath and the fresh, clean outdoor air. The atmospheric background level of CO2 is around 420 parts per million (ppm), while our exhaled breath has concentrations as high as 40,000 ppm. Without ventilation, one or more people breathing in an enclosed space will rapidly lead to an observable increase in CO2 concentration.

Measuring that concentration of CO2 can be accurately and affordably achieved using a small electronic sensor integrated with a basic microcontroller. Two ways of using the resulting information can support the goal of improving indoor air quality:

* For immediate response and action (e.g. opening a window) by the occupants of the room, the CO2 monitor can provide immediate visual feedback, say via a traffic-light style green, orange, red, light display, of the ventilation status of the room. The colour indicator can also be paired with a screen to display the precise CO2 level and associated measurements such as temperature/humidity.

* To enable analysis of trends and assist with planning long-term improvements in ventilation (e.g. install mechanical ventilation) or changes in behaviour (always leaving a window cracked open) the measurements can also be transmitted off the device (e.g. via WiFi) to a web service for long-term storage.

## Deciding to build another CO2 monitoring service

There are a number of existing NZ-based providers selling CO2 monitors including [Air Suite](https://www.airsuite.com/), [Tether](https://www.tether.co.nz/) and [Monkeytronics](https://www.monkeytronics.co.nz/) as well as many additional overseas based options such as [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) and [Aranet](https://aranet.com/) also available.

Unfortunately when evaluating these options as potential candidates to install at our local school, it quickly became obvious that none of them were a perfect match to my requirements for reasons including:

* Cost - generally more than $300 per device, or with no listed price at all and no response/call-back from enquiries via the product website(!).
* Limited or no in-room display or feedback - particularly for the school setting where classrooms are designed to rely only on natural ventilation, this ability to provide clear, immediate feedback so windows can be opened when CO2 levels are rising and ventilation is insufficient is crucial.
* Limited or no data collection or network capability - without the the ability to look at long-term data and trends, it's not possible to effectively advocate for systematic improvements to ventilation or behaviour.

Discovering the DIY friendly Air Gradient device, and then shortly afterwards a very similar NZ based [open source CO2 monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) designed by Oliver Seiler opened the possibilty of building CO2 monitors and an associated monitoring and management platform that would avoid any of the above limitations. I decided it was worth a shot.

## Lessons from iteration one

Oliver's [CO2 Monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) turns out to be close to perfect for my requirements - bright obvious colour LEDs provide an actionable in-room signal and flexible WiFi connectivity and reporting enable the ongoing monitoring and supporting web service. Obtaining and parts and assembling an initial batch of monitors went very smoothly, coming in at a per monitor cost of less than $150 (parts only, time/labour not accounted for at this stage). The monitors were (and still are) successfully deployed to our local school.

The software infrastructure and platform required to support the monitors is relatively straightforward in comparison to the types of systems I've worked with in the past. I've designed and built the systems to enable scaling to many thousand additional monitors and customers in a way that is both cost efficient and requires minimal ongoing maintenance and tending.

My intent in building a system that could cost effectively scale from day one was to enable a sponsorship based business model, where customers would buy a monitor for their own use and we'd donate a matching monitor to a school/charity of their choice.

The initial launch of [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) in conjunction with our local school offered the monitors for sale to individuals and businesses in the school community for $325. Unfortunately take-up of this offer was extremely minimal, with far more people interested in simply donating cash to cover the cost of a monitor in the school, or paying the full price and asking that the second monitor be given the school as well because they didn't know what they'd use it for at home or work.

***Lesson one:** air quality monitoring is less of a priority and perceived problem for the target market than even my low expectations had predicted.*

The second aspect of the initial business model was to price the monitors as affordably as possible (to support the goal of making air quality monitoring more accessible) and build a subscription based SaaS business off the supporting monitoring and management services. From additional sales through friend and family networks after the school deployment, I made another discovery.

***Lesson two:** the number of people who receive value and benefit from the monitoring, graphing and analysis of collected data (aka data geeks, like me) is a very small fraction of the already small set of people interested in buying a CO2 monitor.*

Overall, the first iteration of co2mon.nz was clearly not a viable business. So much so that I decided not to even charge an ongoing subscription to the initial set of customers and paused all further work on the business for several months over the holidays while I re-evaluated the approach.

I have had a lot of fun building out the monitors and supporting infrastructure, and I am providing a useful service to the local school and a few other users which is sufficient for me to call it a successful project, rather than a waste of time - just not a business, yet.

I still think there's enough potential benefit in making air quality monitoring more accessible that it's worth attempting a second iteration.


## The challenge of building hardware

My expertise and experience is with large software systems. Providing an air quality monitoring service has a significant hardware requirement - without a physical monitor to perform and report the measurements, there is no useful service to provide.

Building hardware is notoriously hard. The pandemic induced supply chain chaos particularly afflicted the electronic component industry and reinforced the risks that have always existed when building new electronic devices. Luckily the components I've used to date have remained broadly available, but the risk of spending months of effort and development only to have to redesign around a now unavailable part or component still remains.

On the other hand, as hard and risky as hardware may be, it's also true that it's never been easier and more accessible to build new electronic products thanks to the growing availability of affordable, full-featured chipsets like [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32), increasingly mature [open source design tooling](https://www.kicad.org/), accessible PCB fabrication services and generous folks like [Oliver](https://github.com/oseiler2) who contribute entire designs and projects to the community.

The key challenge I'm currently grappling with is being at an awkward inflection point where manually building and assembling monitors is already not feasible in the quantities I need to develop and grow the business, but the design of the physical monitor is also not polished enough that moving to fully scaled outsourced production is attractive yet.

Outsourcing the PCB assembly (PCBA) and associated components such as the case is definitely feasible, but requires batch sizes of around 100-200 devices to be economical and the lead time I've been quoted per batch (even by NZ-based PCBA services) is on the order of 6-8 weeks from when the design is finalised. Ideally I'd like to be able to outsource production of small 10-20 device batches with new designs every couple of weeks to support rapid product iteration and discovery.

Grappling with this challenge has forced me to re-evaluate just how important to the potential business my perceived hardware requirements actually are. If I were willing to drop the "traffic-light" green/orange/red indication functionality, and settle for a device with an appearance more akin to a smoke alarm, perhaps with just a small screen or a single discreet LED indicator, then many of the existing products that I described above would come back into consideration as a possibility: would it be feasible to buy an existing device on a wholesale/white-label basis as the hardware platform for the co2mon.nz service?

Most of those device manufacturers are also supplying their own monitoring and management platform with the device, meaning it's possible that there would be no interest in supporting a potential competing service by supplying just the hardware, but I think it's worth at least having the conversations and investigating the possibility rather than just assuming that's the case. From what I can see from the public marketing materials of say [Air Suite](https://www.airsuite.com/) and [Tether](https://www.tether.co.nz/), their target customers are large building owners, facility managers and businesses who are likely to purchase a fleet of monitors for their entire portfolio of locations. That target market makes a lot of sense for a business that's aiming for significant scale - but in keeping with my goal to build a series of smaller, niche-focused SaaS business, my target market is more oriented towards making air quality monitoring accessible to individuals and small businesses who don't appear to be well served or targeted by these existing products.

If I can find a partner willing to support this approach, then it will also take pressure off the iteration timelines of outsourcing manufacturing of a purpose built monitor. The purchased devices can be used to support the early iteration and scaling of the business model and service offering while development and testing of what I intend to be our eventual product offering proceeds in the background until the design and production process is stable and mature enough to be relied upon.

## The plan for iteration two

Narrow the target market - small businesses and individuals. Not schools. Not enterprise/corporate large deployments. Leave that to Air Suite/Tether.

Give 6 months of window to show:
- product/market fit - size is not too important, but can I show a steady stream/segment of customers who will buy one of the product ideas below.
- sustainable hardware production - can one of the strategies above be made to work. Is a per-device cost (including materials, time and labour around $200 feasible to achieve?

Business models to explore
* Retry the initial business model with some broader marketing
   - even if the market is small, our unit cost economics are good, so even a small user-base is meaningful.
* Introduce a referral program.
* device rental/subscription including bundled monitoring
   - capture the 1-week/1-month of interest group - see how their office/shop/restaurant performs as a one-off
* short-term rental with an analysis/recommendation product
   - value-add to provide recommendations or interpretation of the raw measurements
* air quality rating and reporting website
  - try and stimulate the demand side.

If none of those show promise, or the hardware ends up being too hard, then easy to take the business back to dormancy and support the existing customers and platform in maintenance mode.
