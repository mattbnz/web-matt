The importance of clean, fresh indoor air is one of the most tangible lessons we can learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Clean, fresh air is not only an incredibly effective risk mitigation for reducing the spread of coronaviruses (and other respiratory illnesses), but has always been important to enable effective cognitive performance.

Monitoring indoor air quality is relatively easy to do, but traditionally has not been a key focus for many of us. I believe air quality monitoring should be accessible to everyone for any indoor space, and for highly occupied indoor spaces should be provided on a continuous basis. Last year, I started [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to enable that monitoring for our local primary school and the service continues to run as a free offering to the school, some local businesses and a few other individuals around NZ.

In this post, the first of a [series](<%? business %>) exploring business ideas, I'm going to look at the potential to expand [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) from a free service into a business which can drive improvement in the accessibility of air quality monitoring leading to better health and performance in our society, covering the following topics along the way:
* [The importance of indoor air quality](#the-importance-of-indoor-air-quality)
* [Observing the invisible](#observing-the-invisible)
* [Current monitoring options](#deciding-to-build-another-co2-monitoring-service)
* [Designing a better monitor](#the-challenge-of-building-hardware)
* [Potential challenges]()
* [A plan to test and validate the product market fit]()

My conclusion is that I don't see a large or significantly profitable business opportunity in ventilation monitoring that is accessible to me at the moment. However, if several significant obstacles can be overcome, there is potential to build a sustainable niche offering which would be well positioned to scale-up and grow if and when demand for ventilation monitoring arrives.

My plan is validate the demand and appetite for the niche service I think I can usefully target, and in parallel to test whether the identified obstacles can indeed by overcome or not. Feel free to jump straight to the details of [that plan](#the-plan-for-iteration-two) if you just want the short summary, or keep reading to understand the thinking that led me to it.


## The importance of indoor air quality

Clean, fresh air is fundamental to life and health. That might sound obvious, but unfortunately being obvious is not enough to ensure the air we breathe is in fact always clean and healthy. Repeated studies have revealed that in many cases the air you're breathing at [school](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1309104218302629?via%3Dihub), [in the bus or at work](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/470690/whose-breath-are-you-breathing) and probably also at [home](https://www.branz.co.nz/pubs/research-now/iaq/1-overview-contaminants/) falls well below the ideal of what clean, fresh air should be.

There's no simple explanation for why we commonly overlook this important aspect of health, but potential contributing factors include:
 * Complexity and visibility. Air quality involves many different variables: temperature, humidity, particulate matter and the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2) all play a role. Other than temperature and humidity, most of these are not easily perceivable until well after adverse effects or irritation occurs.
 * Historical resistance and bias. Up until very recently, aerosol transmission of disease has not been widely accepted, as we saw very clearly with the original (incorrect) rejection of the risk of aerosol transmission of Covid-19. There's [a compelling case](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-airborne-transmission.html) that fear of repeating the mistakes of the early medical theories of miasma and bad air played a large role in the scientific and medical communities overlooking aerosol transmission as a vector.

 I think that history, complexity and our general attention bias towards problems which we can see and focus on provides a reasonable explanation for why air quality is so often overlooked.

In addition to potential [long-term health impacts](https://www.esr.cri.nz/assets/Environmental-reports/h-Health-Effects-Air-Pollution-10Oct22.pdf), poor air quality [lowers cognitive performance](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:27662232) impacting the ability to [learn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132320301074) or [work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd8) effectively and [increases the risk of transmission of diseases](https://www.phcc.org.nz/briefing/monitoring-co2-indoors-improving-ventilation-covid-19-control-tool) like Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses.

**We need to stop overlooking indoor air quality!**

Ventilation (replacing old stale air with clean fresh air) is the most effective and economical method of improving and maintaining high indoor air quality. Most New Zealand buildings (including schools and houses) are designed to rely on manual ventilation (opening windows), while newer buildings, often including larger or commercial buildings may use mechanical ventilation involving fans and ducts.

Both methods of ventilation have their pros and cons, but regardless of how a space is ventilated, a missing component of the puzzle is how to have confidence that the ventilation method in use is working well and delivering adequate levels of clean, fresh air into the indoor environment.

## Observing the invisible

Ventilation can provide an effective strategy to maintain clean, fresh and healthy indoor air, but in order to know whether the current level of ventilation is actually achieving that goal or not we need a way of observing the invisible. While many different types of sensors and measurement equipment exist that can provide this visibility into each aspect of air quality, it's usually simpler and more effective to focus on a single measurement that is an accurate representative of the overall situation.

The concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is one such measurement that is commonly used for this purpose. CO2 provides a simple and effective measure of air quality due to the difference between our exhaled breath and the fresh, clean outdoor air. The atmospheric background level of CO2 is around 420 parts per million (ppm), while our exhaled breath has concentrations as high as 40,000 ppm. Without ventilation, one or more people breathing in an enclosed space will rapidly lead to an observable increase in CO2 concentration.

Measuring that concentration of CO2 can be accurately and affordably achieved using a small electronic sensor integrated with a basic microcontroller. The resulting observations can be used in two ways:

* For immediate response and action (e.g. opening a window) by the occupants of the room, the monitor can provide immediate visual feedback, say via a traffic-light style green, orange, red, light display, of the ventilation status of the room. The colour indicator can also be paired with a screen to display the precise CO2 level and associated measurements such as temperature/humidity.

* To enable analysis of trends and assist with planning long-term improvements in ventilation (e.g. install mechanical ventilation) or changes in behaviour (always leaving a window cracked open) the measurements can also be transmitted off the device (e.g. via WiFi) to a web service for long-term storage.

## Current monitoring options

There are a number of existing NZ-based providers selling CO2 monitors including [Air Suite](https://www.airsuite.com/), [Tether](https://www.tether.co.nz/) and [Monkeytronics](https://www.monkeytronics.co.nz/) as well as many internationally based options such as [Aranet](https://aranet.com/), all of which look to be capable of providing high quality measurements. Unfortunately, looking closer at each offering raised a number of limitations which ruled them out as a perfect match for my requirements:

* Cost or Availability - where prices were listed they were $250+ which quickly adds up when needing 15-20 monitors for a school, and in several cases you can't even directly buy the products on the website, needing to talk to sales first - who in one case didn't even bother responding to my enquiries!
* Limited or no in-room display or feedback - particularly for the school setting where classrooms are designed to rely only on natural ventilation, this ability to provide clear, immediate feedback so windows can be opened when CO2 levels are rising and ventilation is insufficient is crucial.
* Limited or no data collection or network capability - without the the ability to look at long-term data and trends, it's not possible to effectively advocate for systematic improvements to ventilation or behaviour.

Discovering the DIY friendly [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) project, and then shortly afterwards a very similar NZ based [open source CO2 monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) designed by Oliver Seiler opened the possibilty of building CO2 monitors and an associated monitoring and management platform that would avoid any of the above limitations. I decided it was worth a shot.

TIDI: *Hardware is hard, but seemed feasible to try.

## Lessons from iteration one

Oliver's [CO2 Monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) turns out to be close to perfect for my requirements - bright obvious colour LEDs provide an actionable in-room signal and flexible WiFi connectivity and reporting enable the ongoing monitoring and supporting web service. Obtaining and parts and assembling an initial batch of monitors went very smoothly, coming in at a per monitor cost of less than $150 (parts only, time/labour not accounted for at this stage). The monitors were (and still are) successfully deployed to our local school.

The software infrastructure and platform required to support the monitors is relatively straightforward in comparison to the types of systems I've worked with in the past. I've designed and built the systems to enable scaling to many thousand additional monitors and customers in a way that is both cost efficient and requires minimal ongoing maintenance and tending.

My intent in building a system that could cost effectively scale from day one was to enable a sponsorship based business model, where customers would buy a monitor for their own use and we'd donate a matching monitor to a school/charity of their choice.

The initial launch of [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) in conjunction with our local school offered the monitors for sale to individuals and businesses in the school community for $325. Unfortunately take-up of this offer was extremely minimal, with far more people interested in simply donating cash to cover the cost of a monitor in the school, or paying the full price and asking that the second monitor be given the school as well because they didn't know what they'd use it for at home or work.

***Lesson one:** air quality monitoring is less of a priority and perceived problem for the target market than even my low expectations had predicted.*

The second aspect of the initial business model was to price the monitors on a low margin basis (to support the goal of making air quality monitoring more accessible) and use the subscription revenue from providing monitoring and management services to build a SaaS focused business.

***Lesson two:** the number of people who receive value and benefit from the monitoring, graphing and analysis of collected data (aka data geeks, like me) is a very small fraction of the already small set of people interested in buying a CO2 monitor.*

Overall, the first iteration of co2mon.nz's business plan did not show significant potential to be viable SaaS focused business.


## Sustainable hardware production

Compared to software development, producing physical CO2 monitors is a hard problem requiring significant product iteration and careful management of real world supply chain constraints. I've been lucky that none of the batches I've produced yet have suffered from component shortages, but the risks and challenges are real, and mitigating them is not a perfect match for my software oriented skill set and experience.

Manually building and assembling CO2 monitors quickly became unsustainable, and while outsourcing production is entirely feasible via both NZ and China based suppliers, establishing such an outsourced supply chain is going to require some trial and error requiring a reasonable investment of time, effort and money before getting up and running.

Ultimately, to enable another iteration of the business plan there's little choice but to bite the bullet and make it happen, but it will likely require committing to ordering batches of 50-100 monitors on a 6-8 week lead-time, which will make product improvement and iteration slower and more expensive to achieve than the ideal of ordering 10-20 monitors on a 1-2 week lead time.

The most likely alternative, is to investigate the possibility of reselling and customising an existing CO2 monitor, even if it doesn't have the precise feature set I want long term. The benefit of this would be to provide risk mitigation against delays in establishing the outsourced production of CO2 monitors from blocking or hampering further iteration due to lack of devices.

On the other hand, while still hard, it's also never been easier and more accessible to build new electronic products thanks to the growing availability of affordable, full-featured chipsets like [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32), increasingly mature [open source design tooling](https://www.kicad.org/), accessible PCB fabrication services and the availability of open source reference designs such as [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) and Oliver's [CO2Monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor).


## The plan for iteration two

Key changes for the next iteration will be to focus directly on small businesses and individuals as the target customer (rather than targeting schools and reaching the small businesses via sponsorship) and to offer a all-inclusive rental option in addition to being able to directly purchase the monitor.

The attraction of enabling rental is that it has the potential to attract customers like those from the first iteration
who won't buy a monitor as they don't know how they'd use it permanently - but perhaps would be more open and curious to see what their air quality is like over a week or month.

At the end of the rental if they do find value in the visibility that the monitor provides then the option to convert to a long-term rental, or directly purchase the device can be offered. Alternatively, the monitor can simply be returned and rented again to the next customer.

In addition to testing this model with local customers and my personal network, I plan to invest in some marketing/sales advice to reach a broader and wider pool of potential customers. Offering a referral program to incentivize existing customers to introduce their friends and family to the benefits of air quality monitoring also seems like a useful and potentially easy way to reach a bigger audience that I should invest some time into developing.

The success metric for this iteration will be a combination of whether the approach generates a sufficient level of demand to sell or utilise via rental all of the monitors from a production batch, and whether the unit cost economics of that production batch (including time/labour costs) show a tangible path to profitability.
