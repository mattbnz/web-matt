The importance of clean, fresh indoor air is one of the most tangible lessons we can learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Clean, fresh air is not only an incredibly effective risk mitigation for reducing the spread of coronaviruses (and other respiratory illnesses), but has always been important to enable effective cognitive performance.

Monitoring indoor air quality is relatively easy to do, but traditionally has not been a key focus for many of us. I started [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to support the monitoring of air quality in the classrooms of our local primary school and continue to provide it as a free service to the school, some local businesses and a few other individuals around NZ.

I believe air quality monitoring should be accessible to everyone for any indoor space, and for highly occupied indoor spaces should be provided on a continuous basis. In 2022, my first attempt at launching [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to improve the accessibility of indoor air quality monitoring revealed some problems with the intended business model which led me to pause further development. After careful reflection and planning, I'm going to try a second iteration of the business in 2023 as I believe there is still significant need and potential in this space.

Before diving into the details of that plan, I want to rewind and talk about:
* [Why ventilation is important to indoor air quality](#why-ventilation-is-important-to-indoor-air-quality)
* [CO2 is a useful proxy for ventilation](#co2-is-a-useful-proxy-for-ventilation)
* [Deciding to build another CO2 monitoring service](#deciding-to-build-another-co2-monitoring-service)
* [Lessons from iteration one](#lessons-from-iteration-one)
* [The challenge of building hardware](#the-challenge-of-building-hardware)
* [The plan for iteration two](#the-plan-for-iteration-two)

 I won't take offence if you want to skip straight to [the plan](#the-plan-for-iteration-two), but if you are interested in more context around why ventilation monitoring is important, and what I've learnt so far from the first iteration, then please keep reading.

## Why ventilation is important to indoor air quality

Indoor air quality can be a complex topic with many different variables to consider and balance. Temperature, humidity, particulate matter and the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2) all play a role in determining overall air quality. Other than temperature and humidity, most of these factors are not easily perceivable by occupants of a room until well after adverse effects or irritation occurs.

This complexity and the fact that air is invisible explain a large portion of why indoor air quality is often not considered - out of sight, out of mind.

In NZ we are blessed with relatively clean outdoor air and a temperate climate making simple ventilation of indoor spaces with fresh outdoor air an effective technique for improving and maintaining high levels of indoor air quality.

Natural Ventilation, simply opening a window or even better two windows on either side of a space even just slightly, is often sufficient to provide healthy levels of ventilation for a room, and indeed many (perhaps even most) NZ buildings are designed on this basis with natural ventilation assumed to be sufficient to keep the air clean, fresh and healthy. This is a viable strategy if the windows are indeed used as intended - but when air quality is not top of mind, reliance on opening windows for sufficient ventilation will often not work in practice, as windows are not opened early or often enough.

Mechanical ventilation, the provision of fresh outdoor air into a room via fans and ducts, provides a method of delivering fresh air into an indoor space that does not rely on occupants remembering to open windows. Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed specifically for each space to ensure they are sized to deliver sufficient volumes of fresh air for the size of the space and varying numbers of occupants. To perform effectively they also require ongoing maintenance to ensure that components such as filters a regularly cleaned, replaced and working as intended.

Both methods of ventilation have their uses, but regardless of how a space is ventilated, a missing component of the puzzle is how to have confidence that the ventilation method in use is working well and delivering adequate levels of clean, fresh air into the indoor environment.


## CO2 is a useful proxy for ventilation

While it is possible to purchase air quality monitors that report many different aspects of air quality, each additional sensor adds cost and complexity. To avoid this, the common method of monitoring and assessing indoor ventilation is to look simply at the level of CO2 present in the air.

CO2 provides a simple and effective measure of air quality due to the difference between our exhaled breath and the fresh, clean outdoor air. The atmospheric background level of CO2 is around 420 parts per million (ppm), while our exhaled breath has concentrations as high as 40,000 ppm. Without ventilation, one or more people breathing in an enclosed space will rapidly lead to an observable increase in CO2 concentration.

Measuring that concentration of CO2 can be accurately and affordably achieved using a small electronic sensor integrated with a basic microcontroller. Two ways of using the resulting information can support the goal of improving indoor air quality:

* For immediate response and action (e.g. opening a window) by the occupants of the room, the CO2 monitor can provide immediate visual feedback, say via a traffic-light style green, orange, red, light display, of the ventilation status of the room. The colour indicator can also be paired with a screen to display the precise CO2 level and associated measurements such as temperature/humidity.

* To enable analysis of trends and assist with planning long-term improvements in ventilation (e.g. install mechanical ventilation) or changes in behaviour (always leaving a window cracked open) the measurements can also be transmitted off the device (e.g. via WiFi) to a web service for long-term storage.

## Deciding to build another CO2 monitoring service

There are a number of existing NZ-based providers selling CO2 monitors including [Air Suite](https://www.airsuite.com/), [Tether](https://www.tether.co.nz/) and [Monkeytronics](https://www.monkeytronics.co.nz/) as well as many additional overseas based options such as [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) and [Aranet](https://aranet.com/) also available.

Unfortunately when evaluating these options as potential candidates to install at our local school, it quickly became obvious that none of them were a perfect match to my requirements for reasons including:

* Cost - generally more than $300 per device, or with no listed price at all and no response/call-back from enquiries via the product website(!).
* Limited or no in-room display or feedback - particularly for the school setting where classrooms are designed to rely only on natural ventilation, this ability to provide clear, immediate feedback so windows can be opened when CO2 levels are rising and ventilation is insufficient is crucial.
* Limited or no data collection or network capability - without the the ability to look at long-term data and trends, it's not possible to effectively advocate for systematic improvements to ventilation or behaviour.

Discovering the DIY friendly Air Gradient device, and then shortly afterwards a very similar NZ based [open source CO2 monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) designed by Oliver Seiler opened the possibilty of building CO2 monitors and an associated monitoring and management platform that would avoid any of the above limitations. I decided it was worth a shot.

## Lessons from iteration one

Oliver's [CO2 Monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) turns out to be close to perfect for my requirements - bright obvious colour LEDs provide an actionable in-room signal and flexible WiFi connectivity and reporting enable the ongoing monitoring and supporting web service. Obtaining and parts and assembling an initial batch of monitors went very smoothly, coming in at a per monitor cost of less than $150 (parts only, time/labour not accounted for at this stage). The monitors were (and still are) successfully deployed to our local school.

The software infrastructure and platform required to support the monitors is relatively straightforward in comparison to the types of systems I've worked with in the past. I've designed and built the systems to enable scaling to many thousand additional monitors and customers in a way that is both cost efficient and requires minimal ongoing maintenance and tending.

My intent in building a system that could cost effectively scale from day one was to enable a sponsorship based business model, where customers would buy a monitor for their own use and we'd donate a matching monitor to a school/charity of their choice.

The initial launch of [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) in conjunction with our local school offered the monitors for sale to individuals and businesses in the school community for $325. Unfortunately take-up of this offer was extremely minimal, with far more people interested in simply donating cash to cover the cost of a monitor in the school, or paying the full price and asking that the second monitor be given the school as well because they didn't know what they'd use it for at home or work.

***Lesson one:** air quality monitoring is less of a priority and perceived problem for the target market than even my low expectations had predicted.*

The second aspect of the initial business model was to price the monitors on a low margin basis (to support the goal of making air quality monitoring more accessible) and use the subscription revenue from providing monitoring and management services to build a SaaS focused business.

***Lesson two:** the number of people who receive value and benefit from the monitoring, graphing and analysis of collected data (aka data geeks, like me) is a very small fraction of the already small set of people interested in buying a CO2 monitor.*

Overall, the first iteration of co2mon.nz's business plan did not show significant potential to be viable SaaS focused business.


## Sustainable hardware production

Compared to software development, producing physical CO2 monitors is a hard problem requiring significant product iteration and careful management of real world supply chain constraints. I've been lucky that none of the batches I've produced yet have suffered from component shortages, but the risks and challenges are real, and mitigating them is not a perfect match for my software oriented skill set and experience.

Manually building and assembling CO2 monitors quickly became unsustainable, and while outsourcing production is entirely feasible via both NZ and China based suppliers, establishing such an outsourced supply chain is going to require some trial and error requiring a reasonable investment of time, effort and money before getting up and running.

Ultimately, to enable another iteration of the business plan there's little choice but to bite the bullet and make it happen, but it will likely require committing to ordering batches of 50-100 monitors on a 6-8 week lead-time, which will make product improvement and iteration slower and more expensive to achieve than the ideal of ordering 10-20 monitors on a 1-2 week lead time.

The most likely alternative, is to investigate the possibility of reselling and customising an existing CO2 monitor, even if it doesn't have the precise feature set I want long term. The benefit of this would be to provide risk mitigation against delays in establishing the outsourced production of CO2 monitors from blocking or hampering further iteration due to lack of devices.

On the other hand, while still hard, it's also never been easier and more accessible to build new electronic products thanks to the growing availability of affordable, full-featured chipsets like [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32), increasingly mature [open source design tooling](https://www.kicad.org/), accessible PCB fabrication services and the availability of open source reference designs such as [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) and Oliver's [CO2Monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor).


## The plan for iteration two

Key changes for the next iteration will be to focus directly on small businesses and individuals as the target customer (rather than targeting schools and reaching the small businesses via sponsorship) and to offer a all-inclusive rental option in addition to being able to directly purchase the monitor.

The attraction of enabling rental is that it has the potential to attract customers like those from the first iteration
who won't buy a monitor as they don't know how they'd use it permanently - but perhaps would be more open and curious to see what their air quality is like over a week or month.

At the end of the rental if they do find value in the visibility that the monitor provides then the option to convert to a long-term rental, or directly purchase the device can be offered. Alternatively, the monitor can simply be returned and rented again to the next customer.

In addition to testing this model with local customers and my personal network, I plan to invest in some marketing/sales advice to reach a broader and wider pool of potential customers. Offering a referral program to incentivize existing customers to introduce their friends and family to the benefits of air quality monitoring also seems like a useful and potentially easy way to reach a bigger audience that I should invest some time into developing.

The success metric for this iteration will be a combination of whether the approach generates a sufficient level of demand to sell or utilise via rental all of the monitors from a production batch, and whether the unit cost economics of that production batch (including time/labour costs) show a tangible path to profitability.
