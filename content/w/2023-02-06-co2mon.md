## Backstory 

Early last year as NZ abandoned its previous elimination strategy towards covid in the face of Omicron I became unhappy at the lack of attention being given to mitigation measures in NZ schools, and in particular the school that my children attend. As luck would have it, around this time I heard about Oliver Seiler's open source project to provide CO2 monitors to his children's school in Wellington and approached our school about doing the same - they were keen.

During May/June last year, I built and deployed 17 monitors to our school, and a few more to interested friends and family. To my mind, in addition to the direct visual guide to room occupants provided by the "traffic light" LEDs on Oliver's device, the key benefit of having a connected monitor is the ability to record and track patterns in CO2 levels over time, as that allows analysis of correlation between CO2 levels and room usage, ventilation status, and in turn planning and actions to be undertaken to achieve a useful and sustainable balance between ventilation and other needs such as heating and comfort. 

But ongoing monitoring and reporting requires supporting infrastructure, for which the creation and maintenance of which is beyond the abilities of the typical NZ school - it's well within my capabilities to create, but in order to sustain and maintain, it felt to me like I needed a bit more scale than 17 monitors, so the idea of offerring co2mon.nz as a service was born.

## co2mon.nz overview

co2mon.nz is primarily a service for managing and monitoring CO2 monitors based on Oliver Seiler's design. It provides dashboards and graphs showing the history of CO2 concentrations for each monitor associated with your account.

In addition to the web service, I'm also offering the CO2 monitors themselves for sale - necessary to enable use of the service for those who are not able to build their own CO2 monitor in a DIY style.

### Current Status

The service is up and running, and monitors are available for sale. I haven't done any advertising or other marketing to drive usage. Other than my local school the only users of the service are a couple of people who also built monitors from Oliver's designs, who I'm not yet charging for use of the service.

Building the service to its current level took 3-4 months of part time work through June-September. 

### Blockers to progress

After getting the MVP up and running, it became clear that the biggest risk and blocker to further expansion was the provision of hardware itself. I was hand-soldering each monitor together via a mini assembly line in my workshed using 3D self-printed cases which is clearly not a sustainable process. I made some initial explorations of PCB assembly services, which turned up some promising options - even at surprisingly small batch sizes (e.g. 100 boards), but would still require a manual assembly step to install the completed PCB into the physical case, etc.


## Importance of Ventilation

While covid was the hook that raise my awareness of ventilation, the more I've researched and learnt, the more it's clear to me that ventilation is and always has been an important factor of effective indoor environemnts - not just for the health benefits and potential in disease transmission, but also for cognitive performance - the evidence for declines in learning and cognition performance overall in the presence of even relatively moderate CO2 concentrations is clear and compelling.

We should all be motivated to ensure our indoor spaces remain well ventilated, and yet most of us have no visibility or insight into whether the spaces we spend much of our time in are indeed well ventilated, or the relatively simple interventions and changes that could be made to improve their ventilation. 

This is where I think CO2 monitoring can plan an important role - in raising awareness and enabling behavioural change to improve indoor ventilation, and in turn improve health, learning and overall cognitive performance. 

## Competitive space

There are a number of existing players in the CO2 monitoring space in New Zealand that I'm aware of:

  * Tether
  * Smooth Sensors
  * Monkeytronics
  * Aranet 
  * Zigbee
