The importance of clean, fresh indoor air is one of the most tangible lessons we can learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Clean, fresh air is not only an incredibly effective risk mitigation for reducing the spread of coronaviruses (and other respiratory illnesses), but also supports peak cognitive performance.

Monitoring indoor air quality is relatively easy to do, but traditionally has not been a key focus for many of us. I started [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to support the monitoring of air quality in the classrooms of our local primary school and continue to provide it as a free service to the school, some local businesses and a few other individuals around NZ.

I believe air quality monitoring should be accessible to everyone for any indoor space, and for highly occupied indoor spaces should be provided on a continuous basis. The solutions to achieve this are not yet widely accessible. In 2023, my goal is transition [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/) to a paid service that improves the accessibility of indoor air quality monitoring, while being sustainable to run and operate through a small fraction of my time.


## Indoor Air Quality

Indoor air quality can be a complex topic with many different variables to consider and balance including temperature, humidity, particulate matter and the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2) all playing a role. Other than temperature and humidity, most of these factors are not easily perceivable by occupants of a room until well after adverse effects or irritation occurs. This complexity and the fact that air is invisible and not commonly considered explain a large portion of why indoor air quality is often not a top of mind topic or consideration.

In NZ we are blessed with relatively clean outdoor air and a temperate climate making simple ventilation of indoor spaces with outdoor air an effective technique for improving and maintaining high levels of indoor air quality. Simply opening a window, or better two windows on either side of a space, even just slightly is often sufficient to provide healthy levels of ventilation for a room, and indeed many (perhaps even most) NZ buildings are designed on this basis with natural ventilation assumed to be sufficient to keep the air clean, fresh and healthy. This can be a viable strategy if the windows are indeed used as intended - but as air quality is often not top of mind in practice relying on natural ventilation via windows results poor indoor air quality as windows are not opened early or often enough.

Mechanical ventilation (the provision of fresh outdoor air into a room via fans and ducts) provides a method of delivering fresh air into an indoor space without relying on the occupants to open windows. Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed specifically for each space to ensure they are sized to deliver sufficient volumes of fresh air for the size of the space and varying numbers of occupants. To perform effectively they also require ongoing maintenance to ensure that components such as filters a regularly cleaned, replaced and working as intended.

Regardless of ventilation method (natural, mechanical) what we need to be confident that our indoor air is clean, fresh and healthy is a way to monitor and report whether the ventilation strategy in use is actually working.


## Ventilation Monitoring

To form an understanding of whether a space is sufficiently ventilated does not require monitoring all of the many air quality factors described above. While it is possible to purchase air quality monitors with sufficient sensors to measure each of these variables it significantly increases the cost and complexity of both the monitoring device itself and the resulting data analysis. To avoid this cost and complexity, the common method of monitoring and assessing indoor ventilation is to look simply at the level of CO2 present in the air.

CO2 provides a simple and effective measure of air quality and ventilation due to the difference between our exhaled breath and the fresh, clean outdoor air. The atmospheric background level of CO2 is around 420 parts per million (ppm), while our exhaled breath has concentrations as high as 40,000 ppm. Without ventilation, one or more people breathing in an enclosed space will rapidly lead to an observable increase in CO2 concentration.

Measuring the concentration of CO2 in a space can be accurately and affordable achieved using a small electronic sensor based on NDIR technology, which (in a highly simplified explanation) beams infrared light of a particular frequency that happens to interact with CO2 molecules through a small chamber and measures the concentration based on the light received back.

### Application of CO2 Monitoring

With the ability to reliably measure CO2 available, the next question to address becomes how to turn that into useful and actionable information for the occupants or managers of the spaces being monitored.

* First, for immediate response and action (e.g. opening a window) by the occupants of the room we can pair the CO2 sensor with some coloured lights to provide a quick visual representation (green, orange, red) of the ventilation status of the room.

* Second, to support analysis of trends and strategic planning we can transmit and record the data over time in a service such as [co2mon.nz](https://co2mon.nz/). Based on this data we can plan long-term improvements in ventilation (e.g. install mechanical ventilation) or changes in behaviour (always leaving a window cracked open), which can keep the monitor in the green, without needing constant response actions by the occupants of a space.

### Build vs Buy

When I started investigating how to provide ventilation monitoring for our local school, it was quickly obvious that there are a growing number of NZ-based providers in this space include Smooth Sensors, Tether, Monkeytronics and XXX, as well as additional overseas based options such as AirGradient and Aranet also available.

Reasons not to use these include
- Cost, 400+ per device
- Lack of clear in-room display
- Lack of data collection/storage capability
- Unavailability in small/one-off quantities, focus on large contracts.

AirGradient is the one option that avoids most of these issues, and turns out to be very similar in design and concept to a NZ based [open source CO2 monitor](https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor) designed by Oliver Seiler.

## co2mon.nz

Oliver's device has the potential to provide a close to perfect solution for what we want - providing accurate, accessible ventilation monitoring, but
- requires electronics skills to build the device
- requires IT skills to operate the monitoring and configuration stack

I committed to providing those skills to deliver ventilation monitoring for our local primary school, and having made that committment extendign the opportunity to a small number of other businesses and individuals was relatively easy to also commit to.

My initial business plan was to sell the hardware at close to cost, and aim to build a traditional SaaS business on the ongoing monitoring and service fees.

## Initial Lessons

### Hardware is hard
After getting the MVP up and running, it became clear that the biggest risk and blocker to further expansion was the provision of hardware itself. I was hand-soldering each monitor together via a mini assembly line in my workshed using 3D self-printed cases which is clearly not a sustainable process. I made some initial explorations of PCB assembly services, which turned up some promising options - even at surprisingly small batch sizes (e.g. 100 boards), but would still require a manual assembly step to install the completed PCB into the physical case, etc.

### Limited demand for ongoing monitoring
Initial customer feedback, both direct and via analysis of dashboard usage shows that the demand for ongoing monitoring is low. Data geeks like me are interested in seeing an ongoing graph of CO2 levels over time, but most uses find the direct feedback from the device itself to be more useful and don't have the need or motivation to also look at the graphs or history online.

This implies that the strategy of selling hardware near cost, and relying on the SaaS model for ongoing revenue is not likely to be successful.

A rental model is one potential opportunity to address this that I'd like to explore - a bundled CO2 monitor and web services for a week or a month

### Infrastructure and maintenance overhead is low
I spent around 2 months building out the infrastructure to support the co2mon.nz on AWS. I haven't touched it much since October and its still running perfectly, there's obviously going to be some ongoing maintenance and work required to sustain it, but I'm pretty happy with the overall architecture (maybe the topic of a future post) and its ability to sustain probably more growth (e.g. up to several thousands of monitors) than I expect to have to deal with without significant further investment or change.


## 2023 Plan

Despite the necessary focus on hardware that continued operation of co2mon.nz will require not falling within my core areas of expertise, I'm still enthusiastic to continue with the business in 2023, but with a constrained expectation of growth

* Reduce per-device cost (including materials, time and labour below $200. This will require transitioning to a pre-assembled PCB, outsourcing of case/cover manufacturing and contract labour other than me for final assembly, provisioning and testing.

* Explore and introduce a pricing model for the web service, even if only a small percentage of customers take up the additional functionality they should pay for the value they're receiving.

* Test the rental market idea.
