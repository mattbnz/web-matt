It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve taken any sort of quiz like this, so when David Farrar from Kiwblog [posted his results][1] today it prompted me to give it another go.

**My Political Views**  
I am a center-right moderate social libertarian  
Right: 1.33, Libertarian: 1.97

[Political Spectrum Quiz][3]

I completed the quiz pretty quickly and felt the need to answer &#8216;it depends on the specifics&#8217; to many of the questions, so take the results with a grain of salt. I think it is a reasonably accurate description of me though.
