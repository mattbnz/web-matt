Electrifying NZ's energy needs could reduce X% of NZ's carbon emissions. Getting to that point will require XXM of investment over the next 10 years, according to a recent BCG report. Much of that's on physical infrastructure, but flexibility and management is also going to play a crucial role in ensuring that investment performs optimally and that we don't overinvest or waste money building physical infrastructure to the sum of peaks.

Understandably this potential has already given rise of significant conversations on how to achieve this flexibility, both here in NZ and there are plenty of overseas examples to reference too - but I'm also finding it hard to separate actual progress towards implementatino and impact from the discussions on potential and hopes.

As I stated in my goals, I think there's huge potential to apply my background and skillset with distributed software systems somewhere in this transitino to help accelerate it, but I don't know precisely where or what the best opportunity is yet.

To try and help bridge that gap in my understanding between all the exciting conversations and what's actually happening, or ready to happen I'm going to write a series of posts to help order my thoughts.


1) The structure of the NZ electricity industry, covering the 6 major players but specifically looking at how and where flexibility and software systems are or will need to play a major role in their operations, and the maturity and completeness of those solutions today.

2) I want to look at flexibility and DER in general, what's worked overseas and start to expand and understand the many acronyms and what they cover.

3) With all that basic understanding in place, I want to start digging in to how it actually applies to NZ, I have a number of questions which I want to try and answer, or confirm that there is no current answer.
 * Metering - real time data.
 * Marketplace - trading services.
