On the front page of this site, I offer to help you apply SRE practices to balance reliability against your other business needs -
SRE seems to be a hot topic in certain sectors of the technology industry, there's no end of writing and talks on what it is or how to do it better, or how it relates to DevOps, Platform Engineering, DevSecOps, etc, etc. Depending on your perspective all this discussion is fascinating and useful or just tiring and verbose.
