SRE seems to be a hot topic in certain sectors of the technology industry, there's no end of writing and talks on what it is or how to do it better, or how it relates to DevOps, Platform Engineering, DevSecOps, etc, etc. Depending on your perspective all this discussion is fascinating and useful or just tiring and verbose. I'm somewhere in the middle,leaning towards the latter, and yet here I am about to add yet another opinion to the mix.

In my defence, I'm not aiming to change anyone's mind - this post is intended for potential consulting clients who want to understand how I approach SRE and what perspective I'll bring to their business and teams if we work together.


# What is SRE?

This is where our problem starts because SRE is many things, and much of the confusion and debate stems from not understanding or internalising that fact and then wasting hours debating past each other...

Principles, Practices, Role, Discipline.

Beliefs, Actions, Job, Team/Industry.


# Principles

- big picture view, wholistic ownership of a system
- blameless, learning systematic culture
- grounded in reality, metrics/observability, operations.
- empowered and abel to change and improve the system
