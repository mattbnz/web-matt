Matt Brown's Patches for Original
=================================

See http://jimmac.musichall.cz/original.php for the original tarball.

Original Rocks. Thanks Jimmac!

I've hacked up a few patches to make it rock even more, some have general use,
some are probably specific to my site.

General Use Patches
-------------------

thumbroll-highlight.patch
  Put a different coloured border around the currently selected image in the
  thumbroll to help with navigation.

always-show-thumbroll.patch
  Make the thumbroll a permanent fixture of the page.

theme-list.patch
  Only show the list of alternative themes if there is actually more than one
  theme defined in the configuration file.

original-urlhandling.patch
  If magic_gpc_quotes is enabled on your webserver gallery names with a '
  character in them will not work. This patch calls stripslashes on the 
  gallery name to remove the extraneous slash added by PHP. This patch
  also takes care of calling rawurlencode before writing gallery names into
  HTML tags to ensure that galleries with punctation in the name still work.

Possible Use Patches
--------------------

description-at-top.patch
  Show the album description above the thumbnails so that it is immediately 
  visible on albums with lots of images. It gets lost at the bottom of the 
  page.

quality-buttons-at-side.patch
  Make the page more vertically compact by displaying the MQ/HQ buttons to
  the left of the image.

Local Use Patches
-----------------

mattb-config.patch
  My config file diff so that I can easily apply it to the next version of
  Original.

mattb-style.patch
mattb-style.tar.bz2
  Style definitions and patch to integrate with my website. Apply the patch
  and untar the tarball into inc/styles.
